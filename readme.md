### Description
This project began as a result of my taking of the course for JavaScript Design Patterns from Udacity (UD-989). The final project was to build a very basic app called Cat Clicker which undergoes a few requirements changes ([requirements.txt](https://github.com/AlexandruVoica/cat-clicker-premium/blob/master/requirements.txt)).
