# Cat Clicker Premium v1.1
![stability-wip](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-work_in_progress-lightgrey.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square)

### Description
This project began as a result of my taking of the course for JavaScript Design Patterns from Udacity (UD-989). The final project was to build a very basic app called Cat Clicker which undergoes a few requirements changes ([requirements.txt](https://github.com/AlexandruVoica/cat-clicker-premium/blob/master/requirements.txt)). I have also added a few twists to the initial requirements of the course project:
  - The list of cats is presented as a collection of photos (vs. a list of names).
  - Each cat's name is randomly generated.
  - Each cat's photo is a random image fetched via an API.
  - The photos are interactive (resting, hovered and clicked state).
  - The entire app has an overarching design.
